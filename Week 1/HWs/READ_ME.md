HW was graded...
Grades are as follows. 
part 5 was ungraded as I neglected to finish it- 
	I wrote the steps to solve it in C++ mindset (checks and looping iterations) with a remove if equal.
Part 4 = teacher oversight
	seriously weird question- hard to understand but the I/O showed basically 2x mult so...
Part 3 = fine
	While loop was appreciated
Part 2 = okay
	I can't English; like for most of the first week of python class- 
		I took input == user input. 
	wrote code as user does some work and will auto spit answer
	code SHOULD have been, here are parametres(sp?) and calling file == answer for params asked in code

Overall note:
This is PYTHON.
Stop C++ -ing in Python. 
Learn Engrish!
